# Docker Development Environments

For info about these containers refer to the original [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gabrieleara/dev_environments).

This repo should contain a bunch of Docker environments that will be built into
images on Docker Hub.

Each branch (excluding `main`) corresponds to a different image tag that will be
hosted on Docker Hub. Check them out if you want to see the original
`Dockerfile`s, some resources that I commonly use in those environments
(including VSCode `devcontainer.json` commonly used values) and so forth.
