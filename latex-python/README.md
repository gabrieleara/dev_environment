# Docker Development Environments


A set of Docker environments with my typical development configurations.

For info about these containers refer to the original [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/gabrieleara/dev_environment).

# LaTeX-Python Development Environment

A LaTeX development docker container with some Python tools and packages based
on my other LaTeX development container.

The correct link to prebuilt images for the linked Dockerfile is:
```
gabrieleara/dev_environment:latex-python
```

The [devcontainer.json](devcontainer.json) file shows typical settings that I
use on dev containers that use the image provided by the linked Dockerfile.
